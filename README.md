### Elevator Pitch
Have you ever felt terrible, or even just "off," but struggled to understand why? Have you ever finally figured out what's wrong with you, only to fail to find any solutions? If you are autistic or otherwise neurodivergent, these might be very familiar situations for you. Neurospicy Care is designed to help you think through why you don't feel as good, and then give you a suggestion for self care. You can even add friends and congratulate them for taking care of themselves!

### Design

### Key Features
- Account creation and login
- Journal-like text entries that are persistently stored and can be viewed from your personal page
- Ability to access pre-populated problems and their linked self-care suggestions
- Ability to personalize the site by adding and removing problems and self-care suggestions
- Only see one self-care suggestion based on that problem to mitigate descision anxiety
- Ability to record completion of a self-care suggestion and its effectiveness
- Ability to share with friends that you practiced self-care, and to see and congratulate friends on their self-care
- Protects privacy and well-being by only sharing that "\<Username\> practiced self care!" and not the specifics of what they did

### Technologies
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:
- **HTML** - Five HTML pages: login, personalize self-care, selection of problem, self-care suggestion, and friends.
- **CSS** - Styling that looks good on different screen sizes
- **JavaScript** - Provides login, transfer input information, link problems and suggestions together, randomly generate suggestions.
- **Service**
- **DB/Login**
- **WebSocket**
- **React**
