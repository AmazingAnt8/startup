# CS 260 Notes
## Winter 2024 | Ari Tanner
### Can use on midterm and final

### GitHub assignment (1/10/24)
[README file](README.md)
I learned how to resolve conflicts between my changes and GitHub's changes.
- Basically just follow what the terminal tells you and pull stuff within Visual Studio.

I also learned how to write [markdown files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Start-up Requirements (1/12/24)
HTML - Basic structural and organizational elements

CSS - Styling and animating

JavaScript - Interactivity (e.g. What happens when a user presses a button)

Web service - Remote functions that your application calls on your, or someone else's, web server (e.g. saveScores, getWeather, chatWithFriend)

Authentication - Creating accounts and logging in

Database persistence - Storing user data in a database (e.g. Save the high scores and login information)

WebSocket - Support for pushing data from the server. This can be peer to peer communication (e.g. chatting with friends through the browser), or realtime data from the server (e.g. stock prices or the current game leader).

Web framework - Using React to add components and request routing

### AWS - EC2 (1/19/24)
I learned: DON'T UPDATE/UPGRADE THE UBUNTU THING

Elastic IP: 35.174.135.119

Command to remote shell into server: ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
