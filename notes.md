I learned how to resolve conflicts between my changes and GitHub's changes.
- Basically just follow what the terminal tells you and pull stuff within Visual Studio.

I also learned how to write [markdown files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
